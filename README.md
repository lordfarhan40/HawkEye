# HawkEye  
The Repository contains a python code that generates List ofActive Nodes in a given subnet.  
nodelist is the list of all the nodes and contains both IP and MAC addresses  
liveIPs is the list of all IPs that are active  
Read contestDetails.txt file for more details   

Application is written in python2  
Other requirements:  
- nmap  
- scapy  

Try imporving the application  
Some things that can be done:  
- Try adding more information regarding nodes in the list. Like open ports and services  
- You can definitely use concepts of OOPs here  
- Try adding a GUI Interface to the application  
- You can also show active nodes in the form of GUI and incorporate nodes from other subnet and show connections among them.  
- You are allowed to add any other feature you want.    
- In case you are not comfortable with python, you are allowed to use another language. Simply  
output the result (like IPs and MACs) to an external file and use another language to build the improved application.
